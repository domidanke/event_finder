Flutter Event Finder App

# Run firebase login
# Run firebase init

# To run the code in test, use the following command:

# firebase emulators:start --import ./emulators_data --export-on-exit

# This will use a local version of auth, firestore, and firestorage
# To properly terminate the emulator suite, press ctrl+c

# If ports are occupied, use the following command to make space for the emulator suite: sudo npx kill-port 8080


# If experiencing ios build issues, delete podfile.lock and, inside the ios folder, run
# pod deintegrate, pod setup, pod install

# When verifying email addresses in local emulator, the email does not actually get sent,
# but instead, the emultor console prints a link to verify the email
